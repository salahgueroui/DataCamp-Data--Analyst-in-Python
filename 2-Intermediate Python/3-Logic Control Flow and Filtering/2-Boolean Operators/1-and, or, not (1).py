## Exercise
## and, or, not (1)

## Instructions
## - Write Python expressions, wrapped in a print() function, to check whether:
##   * my_kitchen is bigger than 10 and smaller than 18.
##   * my_kitchen is smaller than 14 or bigger than 17.
##   * double the area of my_kitchen is smaller than triple the area of your_kitchen.

## MY SOLUTION:

# Define variables
my_kitchen = 18.0
your_kitchen = 14.0

# my_kitchen bigger than 10 and smaller than 18?
print(my_kitchen>10 and my_kitchen<18)

# my_kitchen smaller than 14 or bigger than 17?
print(my_kitchen<14 or my_kitchen>17)

# Double my_kitchen smaller than triple your_kitchen?
print((my_kitchen*2)<(your_kitchen*3))
