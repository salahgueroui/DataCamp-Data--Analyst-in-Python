## Exercise
## Driving right (1)

## Instructions
## - Extract the drives_right column as a Pandas Series
##   and store it as dr.
## - Use dr, a boolean Series, to subset the cars DataFrame.
## - Store the resulting selection in sel.
## - Print sel.
## - Assert that drives_right is True for all observations.

## MY SOLUTION:

'''
# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Extract drives_right column as Series: dr
dr=cars['drives_right']

# Use dr to subset cars: sel
sel=cars[dr]

# Print sel
print(cars)
print (sel)
